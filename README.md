### Colour Scheme

### Typography

The primary font I have chosen for my project is *Sansita Swashed* and the secondary font I have selected is *Roboto*. 
The secondary font is used if there are any issues presenting the primary font.
The fonts were both taken from [Google-Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sansita+Swashed?query=sansita+s#standard-styles).
